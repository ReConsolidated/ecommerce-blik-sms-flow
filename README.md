This project allows E-Commerce stores to convert more Abandoned Checkouts into paying customers.

It uses:
- TPAY&BLICK for payments
- SMS for customer communication
- OVH Email Service for notifying store about order being fulfilled
- Shopify API for querying of abandoned checkouts.

The client receives an SMS message and can respond with a BLIK code to pay for the checkout without opening the website again.
The project was ordered by an e-commerce store, but hasn't yet been deployed live.
